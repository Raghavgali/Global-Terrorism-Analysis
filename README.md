# Global Terrorism Analysis using Tableau

Welcome to the "Global Terrorism Analysis using Tableau" project repository. This project aims to provide insights and visualizations based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) spanning from the year 1970 to 2017. Utilizing Tableau, this analysis explores patterns, trends, and characteristics of global terrorism incidents over the decades.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of Tableau for comprehensive data visualization and analysis of global terrorism incidents. By extracting valuable insights from the GTD database, we aim to enhance understanding, identify patterns, and contribute to the broader discourse on counter-terrorism efforts.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the [[Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd), covering incidents worldwide from 1970 to 2017. The GTD is a valuable resource providing detailed information on terrorist incidents, including geographical data, attack types, casualties, and more.

## Tableau Visualizations

The Tableau dashboards included in this project showcase various aspects of global terrorism, including but not limited to:
- Geospatial distribution of incidents
- Temporal trends and patterns
- Attack types and their frequency
- Group affiliations and tactics

## Dashboard Usage

To explore the Tableau dashboards:
1. Open Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.
2. Navigate to the respective workbook or visualization file.
3. Interact with the dashboards by selecting filters, hovering over data points, and exploring different sheets.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The process of cleaning and transforming the raw GTD data is documented in the `/data_processing` directory. Details on data cleaning steps, handling missing values, and creating calculated fields can be found here.
